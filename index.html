					<h6>About me</h6>
					Hello, I'm notTitoH. <br />
					I'm an average SOC analyst who likes Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi, Post/Math rock, Nachos, Tacos together with  dark lager  or roasted malt.. or just beer.<br />
					I also like going to the beach.
					
					<h6> What do you do?</h6>
					By day and I help my colleagues panic when there's a Priority 1 Incident. <br />
					But most of the time I try not to get alert fatigue  from the Security Incidents that need to be checked and investigated.
					
					
					<h6>How did you became a SOC analyst?</h6>
					Learned the hard way. Read a lot. Do reasearch. Learn from by amazing colleagues, lovely Chapter Leads and Role Models. <br />
					I also learn from from other CyberSecurity Professionals and Organizations from their blog or vlog posts. <br />
					(like @struppigel, @LiveOverflow, @ghidraninja, @MalwareTechBlog, @sansforensics and many more)
					
					<h6> What tools do you use?</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>
							On the job: Anything that works for me. Usually tools that's in Remnux and/or SIFT. VMs of course, and an old Dell 7000 series Laptop for test machine.<br/>
							Also, the Security Controls that my employer have (EDRs, IPSes, WAFfles, etc).
						</li>
						<li>On Cleaning the house: Broom, Mop, Domex Bleach, and other useful household cleaning stuff. </li>
						<li>On Laundry: Top Load WM, Water, and any detergent that will not cause discoloration.</li>
					</ul>
